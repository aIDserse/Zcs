# Zcs
A series of "educational" applications in C# that I have done as school projects, and fulfilling very broad and particular demands in my opinion I thought might come in handy, at least as an example template on how to perform some particular operations whose documentation can be daunting to understand, at least as a beginner.<br>
## ZPE - Z Photo Editor
A little photo editor made to apply some filters via Marshalling (or in one case with pointers, just to show a different method) to an Image and viewing some of its properties.<br>
The filters are applied both with buttons and sliders.
## ZDP - Z Drawing Program
A litte paint-like program that I made in the first year of high school.<br>
It uses child-classes and I tried to create it respecting formal correctness of things (like public-private ecc, things normal pepole care relatively about).<br>
The design of this program is not how you would want to create an effectively drawing program, but more something you can take inspiration for the libs used.
## Ztick - Z Tic Tac Toe Program
A little tic tac toe program that uses the minimax algorithm.<br>
It uses a 3x3 int array as board and two classes for game and board.
## Zap - Z Appointment Program

A little reservation system, inspired by a simple museum-like interface.<br>
You have to login (and, to insert events, you have to change your role in the database).
There is a confirm program to insert emails, and it is a prefect example for asp.net views, filters, controllers ecc.
