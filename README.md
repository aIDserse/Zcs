# Zcs
A series of c# applications I made in school that I thought might come in handy<br>
All these projects are .NET 4.8.<br>
##ZPE - Z Photo Editor
A little photo editor made to apply some filters via Marshalling (or in one case with pointers) to an Image and viewing some of its properties.<br>
The filters are applied both with buttons and sliders.
